# 🛒 Classic Eshop Online

Modern e-commerce platforms have evolved far beyond simple product listings and checkout flows. Today’s users demand a **fast, responsive, and seamless** shopping experience — with dynamic product catalogs, shopping carts, personalized recommendations, and smooth payment integrations.

Building a backend for an online store goes well beyond basic CRUD operations. It requires a solid architectural foundation capable of handling:

- 🛍️ Real-time product catalog management and inventory updates
- 🛒 Shopping cart operations with concurrency control
- 💳 Secure order processing and payment integrations
- 👤 User authentication, profiles, and order history
- 📦 Modular backend services ready for future microservice decomposition
- ⚡ Scalable APIs to support a growing user base

The challenge lies in designing a system that is both **performant and maintainable**, while remaining **extensible** — ready to add features like promotions, reviews, recommendations, and multi-channel support.

This blueprint breaks down the system’s architecture and components, including:

- Core requirements and design goals
- High-level architecture and module breakdown
- Data models for products, carts, orders, and users
- Infrastructure considerations for scalability and resilience

> Whether you're building your first online store or studying scalable e-commerce architecture, this blueprint is a deep dive into creating a **real-world online shopping platform** with production-ready considerations.
