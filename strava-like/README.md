# 🚴 Strava-like Fitness Application

Modern fitness tracking platforms have evolved far beyond step counters and GPS logs. Today’s users demand a **social, competitive, and seamless** experience — with real-time data sync, challenges, achievements, and tight integration with wearables and health ecosystems.

**Strava** has set a benchmark by combining activity tracking with social engagement: leaderboards, clubs, comments, virtual races, and performance analytics — all delivered through a polished, high-performance user experience.

Building a backend for such an application goes well beyond basic CRUD operations. It requires a solid architectural foundation capable of handling:

- 📍 High-frequency geo-location updates from thousands of concurrent users  
- 🧵 Real-time feed generation and activity broadcasting to followers  
- ⚡ Scalable, low-latency social graph queries  
- 🗺️ Media storage (route maps, photos, achievements)  
- 🧮 Event-driven computation of segments, leaderboards, and personal records  
- 🔒 Fine-grained security and privacy controls over shared data  

The challenge lies in designing a backend that is both **fast and socially engaging**, while remaining **extensible** — ready to integrate third-party fitness devices, support moderation, and evolve with new features.

This blueprint breaks down the system’s architecture and components, including:

- Core requirements and design goals  
- High-level architecture and service breakdown  
- Data models for users, workouts, social interactions, and challenges  
- Infrastructure considerations for scalability and resilience  

> Whether you're designing your own fitness app or studying system architecture at scale, this blueprint is a deep dive into how to build a **real-world social fitness platform** with production-level considerations.
