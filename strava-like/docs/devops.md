# DevOps & CI/CD

The platform adopts a mature, automated DevOps approach focused on reliability, speed, and transparency. Git-centric workflows ensure consistency across the build, test, and release lifecycle.

---

## 1. CI/CD Pipeline Structure

Workflows are fully integrated with version control systems like **GitHub**, **GitLab**, or **Bitbucket**. Pipelines are triggered on pull requests, merges to main branches, and tag events. CI/CD is considered a critical component of the platform, emphasizing performance, traceability, and security.

### **Pipeline Stages**

- **Build**
  - Multi-stage Dockerfiles used per service.
  - Shared base images are cached for faster builds.
  - Frontend pipelines include:
    - Tree-shaking
    - Transpilation
    - Bundle size analysis

- **Test**
  - Unit, integration, and contract tests run in isolated jobs.
  - Test results (e.g., logs, coverage reports) are uploaded as artifacts.
  - Inline annotations on PRs highlight test failures for quick feedback.

- **Security Scanning**
  - Static analysis tools (e.g., `SonarQube`, `Snyk`) scan code and dependencies.
  - Secrets scanning ensures sensitive data isn't committed.
  - Security gates block promotion of vulnerable builds.

- **Image Signing**
  - Built container images are cryptographically signed and stored in trusted registries like:
    - AWS ECR
    - GCP Artifact Registry
  - Immutable tags and provenance metadata ensure traceability.

- **Staging Deployment**
  - Tagged versions are deployed to staging environments automatically.
  - Canary checks, smoke tests, and synthetic probes validate stability.

- **Production Promotion**
  - Promotion is gated by QA outcomes.
  - Deployments may be triggered manually (with approvals) or automatically.
  - GitOps tools such as `ArgoCD` or `Flux` sync desired state from version-controlled manifests.

## 2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Infrastructure is entirely codified and versioned for reproducibility and safety.

- **Terraform**
  - Used to manage all resources: VPCs, Kubernetes clusters, databases, IAM, message queues, etc.
  - All changes reviewed through `terraform plan` in pull requests.
  - Nightly drift detection alerts on out-of-band modifications.

- **Helm & Kustomize**
  - Kubernetes manifests are generated via `Helm`.
  - Environment-specific differences are handled with `Kustomize` overlays for easy overrides (e.g., replicas, secrets).

- **Secrets Management**
  - Secrets are handled securely via tools like:
    - `SOPS` (Mozilla)
    - `Sealed Secrets` (Bitnami)
    - HashiCorp Vault sidecar injection
  - Secrets rotation and audit logging are enforced as part of compliance.

---

## 3. Deployment Strategy

Deployments are progressive, resilient, and observable.

- **Blue-Green Deployments**
  - Used for high-impact services (e.g., Authentication).
  - Traffic is gradually switched between old and new versions.
  - Automatic rollback on failed health checks.

- **Canary Releases**
  - Applied to less sensitive services (e.g., Notifications).
  - Incremental rollout: 5% → 25% → 100%.
  - Rollout progress based on key metrics (latency, error rate, CPU usage).

- **Feature Flags**
  - All significant changes are feature-flagged.
  - Supports dark launches, progressive exposure, and quick rollback in production.

## 4. Artifact & Environment Hygiene

Efficiency and environment isolation are enforced to maintain quality over time.

- **Image Lifecycle Management**
  - Old container images are automatically cleaned up.
  - Retention policies based on age or SHA.
  - Long-term images (e.g., rollback candidates) are explicitly tagged.

- **Preview Environments**
  - Each PR spins up a **temporary Kubernetes namespace**.
  - These ephemeral environments mirror production topology.
  - Automatically destroyed on merge or PR closure.

- **Rollback Procedures**
  - Every deployment is versioned and atomic.
  - Rollbacks can be triggered via:
    - Git `revert`
    - `Helm` history rollback
    - `ArgoCD` UI
  - Rollbacks complete within seconds for minimal disruption.
