# üìã System Requirements

This section outlines the core requirements for building a Strava-like fitness tracking platform. The system must support **high-frequency activity tracking**, **real-time social features**, and **integration with third-party health ecosystems**, all while remaining **scalable**, **secure**, and **extensible**.

---

## 1. Functional Requirements

To deliver a compelling user experience, the system must support the following core functionalities:

- **User Management**
  Registration, login, password recovery, and profile editing.

- **Activity Recording**
  Capture GPS-based workouts (e.g., runs, rides), manual entries, and metadata such as distance, pace, elevation, heart rate, and gear used.

- **Real-Time Data Sync**
  Stream geo-location and sensor data from mobile and wearable devices with low latency.

- **Social Graph**
  Follow/unfollow users, discover connections, and control visibility (private, followers-only, or public).

- **Activity Feed**
  Show a timeline of activities from followed users with support for likes, comments, and re-shares.

- **Challenges & Leaderboards**
  Create and join time-limited challenges (e.g., ‚ÄúRide 100km in 7 days‚Äù), track segment performances, and asynchronously compute rankings.

- **Media & Achievements**
  Upload/view photos, heatmaps, badges, and personal milestones.

- **Notifications**
  Real-time push and in-app notifications for social interactions and challenge updates.

- **Third-Party Integrations**
  Sync data from platforms such as Apple Health, Google Fit, Garmin, and others.

## 2. Non-Functional Requirements

The platform must also meet a number of non-functional requirements to ensure reliability and performance at scale:

- **Scalability**
  Services and storage layers must scale horizontally to support millions of users and terabytes of geo-temporal data.

- **Low Latency**
  Sub-second response times for real-time interactions and live map rendering.

- **Availability**
  99.9%+ uptime, with fault-tolerant deployment across multiple availability zones or regions.

- **Security & Privacy**
  OAuth2-based authentication, encrypted data at rest and in transit, and granular user-controlled sharing settings.

- **Extensibility**
  Modular architecture to enable future features like live coaching, virtual races, or group chats.

- **Data Consistency**
  Eventual consistency is acceptable for feeds and leaderboards; strong consistency required for critical operations (e.g., account settings, payments).

- **Offline Support**
  Enable users to record and queue activities while offline, with automatic sync when connectivity is restored.

## 3. Constraints & Assumptions

- Mobile (iOS & Android) will be the primary platforms; a web interface is optional or secondary.
- Processing of location and health data must comply with regional data protection laws (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA where applicable).
- Most users will sync 1‚Äì2 activities daily; ingestion load may spike during events or global challenges.
- The system assumes a **cloud-native** environment, leveraging managed services for compute, storage, and streaming.
